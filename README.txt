INTRODUCTION

A file conversion tool for translating dsf or dff dsd audio files into
flac pcm audio files.

I originally wrote this because I could not quite find any tool which
did exactly what I wanted.

I program quite a lot in java and I'm pretty good at matlab. Although I've
very occasionally written things in C and CPP, this is really my first attempt
at a full CPP program. I'm sure there are errors, hopefully none to horrible.

I've tried to write things in a pretty versatile/clear way. It should be possible
to expand the functionality to add other file types quite easily.

If you want to try different convesion filters then it should be dead simple:
just look in filters.cpp.


COMPILING

I developed and tested this program on Linux x86_64 with GCC. It probably compile and
works on x86 GCC too. Windows might be a bit more work.

If you are building statically you'll need to link against these libs:

FLAC++
FLAC
boost_system
boost_timer
boost_filesystem
boost_chrono
id3
z
rt
ogg

The list is a little smaller if you want to use dynamic linking:

FLAC++
boost_system
boost_timer
boost_filesystem
id3



RUNNING

If you run "dsf2flac -h" you'll get a list of the options.

At the very simplest level you just need to run
"dsf2flac -i some_audio_file.dsf"


BENCHMARK

I was quite pleased with the performance.
For example, with the default filters (which are quite long) the program
will convert and encode from DSD64 to 24bit 88200Hz flac at around 
14x realtime on my ageing laptop (Intel Core2Duo P8600@2.40GHz)
